# GameOfLife

Runs Conway's game of life.

Running code brings up a grid with some preset arrangement of alive (black) and dead (white) squares. Clicking on any of these squares will flip there state and dragging will flip the state of any of the squares the mouse rolls over. The run button will begin execution of Conway's game of life.
